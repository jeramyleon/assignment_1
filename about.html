    <h1>Mission Statement</h1>
<p>
We are a group of community college students committed to raising awareness about renewable energy and the urgent need to address climate change. 
This website was created to provide clear and accessible information about the impacts of climate change and to highlight the importance of switching to renewable energy sources. 
Our goal is to help others understand the problem, recognize the solutions, and feel empowered to take small steps toward a cleaner and more sustainable future.

    <h2>The Effects of Climate Change</h2>

    <p>Climate change is already affecting our planet in devastating ways — from rising sea levels to record heatwaves. 
    But one of the saddest consequences is the toll it’s taking on animals around the world. Many species are struggling 
    to survive as their habitats disappear or become unlivable.</p>

    <p>Below are a few species you may not have known are at risk of extinction due to climate change:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Polar bears – melting Arctic sea ice</li>
      <li>Coral reefs – ocean warming and acidification</li>
      <li>Monarch butterflies – disrupted migration patterns</li>
      <li>Koalas – intense heat and bushfires</li>
      <li>Snow leopards – shrinking mountain ranges</li>
    </ul>

    <p>But it’s not too late to make a difference. One of the most powerful ways to fight climate change is through renewable energy.</p>

    <h2>Why Renewable Energy?</h2>

    <p>Unlike fossil fuels, renewable energy comes from natural sources that don’t run out — like sunlight, wind, 
    and water. These sources produce little to no greenhouse gases, which makes them a powerful solution to slow 
    down global warming and protect the planet.</p>

    <p>By transitioning to renewable energy, we reduce air pollution, protect wildlife habitats, 
    and invest in a cleaner, safer future for the next generation.</p>

    <h2>What You Can Do</h2>

    <p>Small changes over time can make a <strong>BIG</strong> impact. Turn off lights, 
    reduce waste, and support clean energy efforts in your community.</p> 

    <ul>
      <li>Turn off lights and unplug chargers when not in use</li>
      <li>Reduce car use — walk, bike, or take public transit when you can</li>
      <li>Eat more plant-based meals (meat production creates lots of emissions)</li>
      <li>Support clean energy initiatives and eco-friendly businesses</li>
      <li>Share what you learn with friends and family</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Every action matters. Together, we can create a cleaner, safer future — one step at a time.</p>
